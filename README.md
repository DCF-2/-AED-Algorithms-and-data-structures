# Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS)

This repository contains a collection of common algorithms and data structures implemented in **[add programming language, e.g., C++, Python, Java]**. This project was developed as part of Computer Science studies, aiming to practice and demonstrate the implementation of these fundamental concepts.

## üöÄ About The Project

This project serves as a practical guide and a personal library for various algorithms and data structures. Each implementation is created with a focus on clarity and educational purposes, making it a good resource for learning and revision.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Algorithms and Data Structures

Below is a list of what you will find in this project. Feel free to adapt this list based on what you have implemented.

### Data Structures
- [ ] Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees (e.g., Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- [ ] Hash Tables

### Algorithms
- **Sorting:**
  - [ ] Bubble Sort
  - [ ] Selection Sort
  - [ ] Insertion Sort
  - [ ] Merge Sort
  - [ ] Quick Sort
- **Searching:**
  - [ ] Linear Search
  - [ ] Binary Search
- **Graph Algorithms:**
  - [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - [ ] Depth-First Search (DFS)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **[add prerequisite, e.g., g++, Python 3, JDK]** installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd AED
   ```

### Running the Code

Provide instructions here on how to compile and run your code.

* **Example for C++:**
    ```sh
    g++ your_main_file.cpp -o output
    ./output
    ```
* **Example for Python:**
    ```sh
    python your_main_script.py
    ```
* **Example for Java:**
    ```sh
    javac YourMainFile.java
    java YourMainFile
    ```

## üìÑ How to Use

The program is interactive and runs via the command line. When you start it, a menu will be displayed with options to select and test the desired data structure or algorithm. Follow the on-screen instructions.
